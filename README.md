Grayscale Jekyll theme
=========================

Jekyll theme based on [Grayscale bootstrap theme](http://ironsummitmedia.github.io/startbootstrap-grayscale/).

This fork has been modified to use collections for the contents of the main page. New sections
can be added as markdown files in the `_sections` directory.
